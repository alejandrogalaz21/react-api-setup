 *  IN THE CODE ABOVE, RATHER THAN SET UP A FULL DATABASE CONNECTION, I JUST PSEUDO-CODED IT BUT ADDING IT IS EASY ENOUGH.  *
 * WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR LOGIC ISOLATED LIKE THIS, IT’S EASY TO KEEP IT LIMITED TO JUST DATA ACCESS CODE. IF IT’S NOT OBVIOUS, *
 * “DATA ACCESS LAYER” MEANS THE LAYER THAT CONTAINS YOUR LOGIC FOR ACCESSING PERSISTENT DATA. THIS CAN BE SOMETHING LIKE A *
 * DATABASE, A REDIS SERVER, ELASTICSEARCH, ETC. SO WHENEVER YOU NEED TO ACCESS SUCH DATA, PUT THAT LOGIC HERE. “MODELS” IS *
 *                                       THE SAME CONCEPT BUT USED AS PART OF AN ORM.                                       *
